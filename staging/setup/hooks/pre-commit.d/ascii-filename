# Rejects filenames that are not fully ASCII

# Cross platform projects tend to avoid non-ASCII filenames; prevent
# them from being added to the repository. We exploit the fact that the
# printable range starts at the space character and ends with tilde.

# Note that the use of brackets around a tr range is ok here, (it's
# even required, for portability to Solaris 10's /usr/bin/tr), since
# the square bracket bytes happen to fall in the designated range.

Error: Attempt to add a non-ASCII file name.
This can cause problems if you want to work with people on other platforms.
To be portable it is advisable to rename the file.
